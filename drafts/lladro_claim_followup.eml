Dear Samira,

I hope you are well. I am writing to follow up on the insurance claim for the LLADRO "Karabakh Horse" that was damaged at the Tanagra Vendome store on **20 June 2025**.

Could you please provide an update on the current status of the claim? If the insurer or our internal team require any additional documentation (e.g., further photographs, police report, or revised inventory details), kindly let me know so I can arrange to forward them promptly.

Additionally, it would be helpful to confirm the expected timeline for the next steps – for example, when the claim file will be officially opened, any anticipated review periods, and an estimated date for a decision or payout.

Thank you for your cooperation. I look forward to your response.

Best regards,

Hagop Ghazarian
