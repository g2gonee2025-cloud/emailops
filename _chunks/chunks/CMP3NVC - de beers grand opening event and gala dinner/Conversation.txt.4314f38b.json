(The venue is attached to Dubai Mall: Address Hotel). \n6 Vitrines will be at the venue to showcase these pieces. \n\nTotal Value of goods: 9.5 million AED",

De Beers staff will be onsite to received the sealed transportation bag.\n\nAfter the event, a secured transport should also be scheduled at 23:00 to return the items from the venue with immediate delivery to our boutique so we can secure them in our vault overnight.\n\nLocation: The Restaurant, 12th Floor, Address Hotel, Dubai Mall\n\nOne security guard is to be scheduled at the venue from 16:00 until the departure of the piece.\n\nRomy Ammar, myself, and 2 of my Client Advisors will be on site to receive and re-package the pieces to be returned to our store before closing. \n\nOur in-store team will wait until the pieces are returned from the event to close our store.  \n\n\nIn order to orchestrate this event as smoothly and securely as possible, can we please have your support and guidance? \nPerhaps we can schedule a Teams Meeting if that would be easier for clarity and all parties involved.\n\n\nI look forward to your response.\n\nWith best regards,\nChris Matsumoto\nBoutique Manager\n\n\nDubai Mall - Grand Atrium\nGround Floor, Unit 271\nT: + 971 4 271 9838\ndebeers.dubaimall@chalhoub.com",
