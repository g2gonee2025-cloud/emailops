SEWA Emergency Services and the Fire Department were promptly contacted and responded to the scene.\n\nWe have also reported the incident to our General Manager, Mr. Tarek Abichikra, as well as to the Store Operations Team.\n\nFollowing the assessment by the SEWA team, the replacement of the electrical panel is estimated to take approximately 3 to 10 days, subject for approval. They have confirmed that no additional documents or requirements are needed from our side at this stage.\n\nWe will continue to monitor the situation closely and will keep you informed of any further updates.\n\n \n\nAlternately, click here <https://rso.e-mac.com/pages/ManageINC.aspx?INCGUID=7cbc8135-9cfe-587a-5846-6fd2e1e0fbaf>  to review it on Focus.\n\nThis is an auto-generated email, please do not reply.

SEWA Emergency Services and the Fire Department were promptly contacted and responded to the scene.\n\nWe have also reported the incident to our General Manager, Mr. Tarek Abichikra, as well as to the Store Operations Team.\n\nFollowing the assessment by the SEWA team, the replacement of the electrical panel is estimated to take approximately 3 to 10 days, subject for approval. They have confirmed that no additional documents or requirements are needed from our side at this stage.\n\nWe will continue to monitor the situation closely and will keep you informed of any further updates.\n\n \n\nAlternately, click here <https://rso.e-mac.com/pages/ManageINC.aspx?INCGUID=7cbc8135-9cfe-587a-5846-6fd2e1e0fbaf>  to review it on Focus.\n\nThis is an auto-generated email, please do not reply.

SEWA Emergency Services and the Fire Department were promptly contacted and responded to the scene.\n\nWe have also reported the incident to our General Manager, Mr. Tarek Abichikra, as well as to the Store Operations Team.\n\nFollowing the assessment by the SEWA team, the replacement of the electrical panel is estimated to take approximately 3 to 10 days, subject for approval. They have confirmed that no additional documents or requirements are needed from our side at this stage.\n\nWe will continue to monitor the situation closely and will keep you informed of any further updates.\n\n \n\nAlternately, click here <https://rso.e-mac.com/pages/ManageINC.aspx?INCGUID=7cbc8135-9cfe-587a-5846-6fd2e1e0fbaf>  to review it on Focus.\n\nThis is an auto-generated email, please do not reply.

SEWA Emergency Services and the Fire Department were promptly contacted and responded to the scene.\n\nWe have also reported the incident to our General Manager, Mr. Tarek Abichikra, as well as to the Store Operations Team.\n\nFollowing the assessment by the SEWA team, the replacement of the electrical panel is estimated to take approximately 3 to 10 days, subject for approval. They have confirmed that no additional documents or requirements are needed from our side at this stage.\n\nWe will continue to monitor the situation closely and will keep you informed of any further updates.\n\n \n\nAlternately, click here <https://rso.e-mac.com/pages/ManageINC.aspx?INCGUID=7cbc8135-9cfe-587a-5846-6fd2e1e0fbaf>  to review it on Focus.\n\nThis is an auto-generated email, please do not reply.

SEWA Emergency Services and the Fire Department were promptly contacted and responded to the scene.\n\nWe have also reported the incident to our General Manager, Mr. Tarek Abichikra, as well as to the Store Operations Team.\n\nFollowing the assessment by the SEWA team, the replacement of the electrical panel is estimated to take approximately 3 to 10 days, subject for approval.

      "text": "Subject: Incident Report – Main Electrical Panel Burnout from the main building\n\nDear All,\n\nI would like to inform you that an incident occurred yesterday involving the main electrical panel of the main building, which was damaged due to burning.\n\nAs a precautionary safety measure, all guests and staff members present at the time — Mavju, Mohamed and Yassmin — were immediately evacuated from the building. SEWA Emergency Services and the Fire Department were promptly contacted and responded to the scene.\n\nWe have also reported the incident to our General Manager, Mr. Tarek Abichikra, as well as to the Store Operations Team.\n\nFollowing the assessment by the SEWA team, the replacement of the electrical panel is estimated to take approximately 3 to 10 days, subject for approval. They have confirmed that no additional documents or requirements are needed from our side at this stage.\n\nWe will continue to monitor the situation closely and will keep you informed of any further updates.\n\n \n\nAlternately, click here <https://rso.e-mac.com/pages/ManageINC.aspx?INCGUID=7cbc8135-9cfe-587a-5846-6fd2e1e0fbaf>  to review it on Focus.\n\nThis is an auto-generated email, please do not reply.

SEWA Emergency Services and the Fire Department were promptly contacted and responded to the scene.\n\nWe have also reported the incident to our General Manager, Mr. Tarek Abichikra, as well as to the Store Operations Team.\n\nFollowing the assessment by the SEWA team, the replacement of the electrical panel is estimated to take approximately 3 to 10 days, subject for approval. They have confirmed that no additional documents or requirements are needed from our side at this stage.\n\nWe will continue to monitor the situation closely and will keep you informed of any further updates.\n\n \n\nAlternately, click here <https://rso.e-mac.com/pages/ManageINC.aspx?INCGUID=7cbc8135-9cfe-587a-5846-6fd2e1e0fbaf>  to review it on Focus.\n\nThis is an auto-generated email, please do not reply.

SEWA Emergency Services and the Fire Department were promptly contacted and responded to the scene.\n\nWe have also reported the incident to our General Manager, Mr. Tarek Abichikra, as well as to the Store Operations Team.\n\nFollowing the assessment by the SEWA team, the replacement of the electrical panel is estimated to take approximately 3 to 10 days, subject for approval. They have confirmed that no additional documents or requirements are needed from our side at this stage.\n\nWe will continue to monitor the situation closely and will keep you informed of any further updates.\n\n \n\nAlternately, click here <https://rso.e-mac.com/pages/ManageINC.aspx?INCGUID=7cbc8135-9cfe-587a-5846-6fd2e1e0fbaf>  to review it on Focus.\n\nThis is an auto-generated email, please do not reply.

The actual daily sales figures from this post-reopening trading period are necessary to accurately capture the full extent of the Business Interruption loss.\nA reasonable timeline for a satisfactory claim closure should be by end of October 2025. We will continue to follow up with the insurer to ensure it is handled in a timely manner.\nBest Regards,\nHagop",
