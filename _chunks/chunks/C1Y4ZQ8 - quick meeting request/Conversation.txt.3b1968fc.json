However, they (Ace) have a VP who is ex-NASCO with a not so clean break to put it mildly. So, I usually refrain from approaching them not to antagonize our existing partner. I just used them for one year to make sure we get a competitive offer.\n\nThe Ace team is very good and highly competent and my impression of them was highly positive. However, it is not an issue, there are a lot of highly competent brokers that are still available and interested to compete for the Chalhoub Insurance portfolio so the competitive pressure is always there.\n\nWish you a pleasant and lovely evening.\n\nBest Regards,\nHagop",
