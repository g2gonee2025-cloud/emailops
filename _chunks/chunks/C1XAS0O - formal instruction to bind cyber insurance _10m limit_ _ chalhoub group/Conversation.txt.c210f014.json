There will be an Acquisition or creation of subsidiaries clause in the policy, please find the language below. With this clause; if Chalhoub acquires or creates a subsidiary with less than 25% of their total assets or revenue, coverage automatically extends to that subsidiary for claims arising after the acquisition or creation, or for 90 days if automatic inclusion does not apply, subject to the insurer’s approval.
