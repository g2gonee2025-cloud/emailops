This commitment extends beyond our everyday operations; it’s not just about ticking a box, but rather reinforcing a security-first mindset.\n \nOur new Information Security Charter serves as a foundation for our ongoing commitment to a proactive and comprehensive approach to protecting Group information and business operations. This charter aims to uphold the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our information assets while fostering a culture of security awareness, maintaining regulatory compliance, and most importantly upholding the trust of our customers, partners, team members and stakeholders.",
