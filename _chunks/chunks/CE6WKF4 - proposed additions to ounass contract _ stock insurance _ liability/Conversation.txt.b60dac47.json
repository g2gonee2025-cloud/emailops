However, I would suggest adding some additional clauses to hold Ounass responsible for losses to our stock whist in their custody.\n\n \n\nProposed Contract Additions:\n\n \n\n\"16.6 Ounass shall be responsible for any loss, theft, or damage to the Products while in its possession, including but not limited to pick-up, storage, handling, and delivery. Ounass shall take all reasonable care to ensure the proper handling and safekeeping of the Products and shall be liable for any damages occurring during this period.\"",

Please find attached. \n\nMariel from Tax also came back to me with the below:\n\n\n1.\tWill Ounass hold inventory? If so, under whose name will the goods be cleared into the country – for example when goods are shipped to KSA? This is a critical point to discuss. If Allied’s name will be used to clear goods through customs, this will have significant exposure for Allied in KSA (and all other countries other than the UAE) and Ounass will not be able to return any items back to UAE. If Ounass’ name will be used, the title to the goods must be transferred to Ounass before clearing through customs.",

However, please inform Ounass that this is still under discussion.

If so, under whose name will the goods be cleared into the country – for example when goods are shipped to KSA? This is a critical point to discuss. If Allied’s name will be used to clear goods through customs, this will have significant exposure for Allied in KSA (and all other countries other than the UAE) and Ounass will not be able to return any items back to UAE. If Ounass’ name will be used, the title to the goods must be transferred to Ounass before clearing through customs.\n\n \n\n2.\tHaving one agreement to cover all territories is not advisable. Instead, we can have a master agreement with Chalhoub entities in each country included in an addendum and to have the inventory managed by Chalhoub legal entity in each country and the sales & returns recorded locally.\n\n \n\nThanks,\n\nKim \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nKIMBERLEY PURCELL\n\nDIRECTOR ‑ E‑TAILERS\n\nC.G.R.

If so, under whose name will the goods be cleared into the country – for example when goods are shipped to KSA? This is a critical point to discuss. If Allied’s name will be used to clear goods through customs, this will have significant exposure for Allied in KSA (and all other countries other than the UAE) and Ounass will not be able to return any items back to UAE. If Ounass’ name will be used, the title to the goods must be transferred to Ounass before clearing through customs.\n\n \n\n2.\tHaving one agreement to cover all territories is not advisable. Instead, we can have a master agreement with Chalhoub entities in each country included in an addendum and to have the inventory managed by Chalhoub legal entity in each country and the sales & returns recorded locally.\n\n\nThanks,\nKim \n\n\n\nKIMBERLEY PURCELL\nDIRECTOR ‑ E‑TAILERS\nC.G.R.

Please find attached. \n\n \n\nMariel from Tax also came back to me with the below:\n\n \n\n1.\tWill Ounass hold inventory? If so, under whose name will the goods be cleared into the country – for example when goods are shipped to KSA? This is a critical point to discuss. If Allied’s name will be used to clear goods through customs, this will have significant exposure for Allied in KSA (and all other countries other than the UAE) and Ounass will not be able to return any items back to UAE. If Ounass’ name will be used, the title to the goods must be transferred to Ounass before clearing through customs. Can you please advise on this as it is purely operational?",

Instead, we can have a master agreement with Chalhoub entities in each country included in an addendum and to have the inventory managed by Chalhoub legal entity in each country and the sales & returns recorded locally. We usually have a master agreement but we mention the operating entity in each country in a table (page 2 of the agreement) can you please confirm if each local entity managers inventory/ sales and returns locally?\n\n \n\nThanks,\n\nKim \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nKIMBERLEY PURCELL\n\nDIRECTOR ‑ E‑TAILERS\n\nC.G.R.

Please find attached. \n\n \n\nMariel from Tax also came back to me with the below:\n\n \n\n1.\tWill Ounass hold inventory? If so, under whose name will the goods be cleared into the country – for example when goods are shipped to KSA? This is a critical point to discuss. If Allied’s name will be used to clear goods through customs, this will have significant exposure for Allied in KSA (and all other countries other than the UAE) and Ounass will not be able to return any items back to UAE. If Ounass’ name will be used, the title to the goods must be transferred to Ounass before clearing through customs. Can you please advise on this as it is purely operational?",

Instead, we can have a master agreement with Chalhoub entities in each country included in an addendum and to have the inventory managed by Chalhoub legal entity in each country and the sales & returns recorded locally. We usually have a master agreement but we mention the operating entity in each country in a table (page 2 of the agreement) can you please confirm if each local entity managers inventory/ sales and returns locally?\n\n \n\nThanks,\n\nKim \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nKIMBERLEY PURCELL\n\nDIRECTOR ‑ E‑TAILERS\n\nC.G.R.

However, I would suggest adding some additional clauses to hold Ounass responsible for losses to our stock whist in their custody.\n\n \n\nProposed Contract Additions:\n\n \n\n\"16.6 Ounass shall be responsible for any loss, theft, or damage to the Products while in its possession, including but not limited to pick-up, storage, handling, and delivery. Ounass shall take all reasonable care to ensure the proper handling and safekeeping of the Products and shall be liable for any damages occurring during this period.\"",

Please find attached. \n\n \n\nMariel from Tax also came back to me with the below:\n\n \n\n1.\tWill Ounass hold inventory? If so, under whose name will the goods be cleared into the country – for example when goods are shipped to KSA? This is a critical point to discuss. If Allied’s name will be used to clear goods through customs, this will have significant exposure for Allied in KSA (and all other countries other than the UAE) and Ounass will not be able to return any items back to UAE. If Ounass’ name will be used, the title to the goods must be transferred to Ounass before clearing through customs. Can you please advise on this as it is purely operational?",

Instead, we can have a master agreement with Chalhoub entities in each country included in an addendum and to have the inventory managed by Chalhoub legal entity in each country and the sales & returns recorded locally. We usually have a master agreement but we mention the operating entity in each country in a table (page 2 of the agreement) can you please confirm if each local entity managers inventory/ sales and returns locally?\n\n \n\nThanks,\n\nKim \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nKIMBERLEY PURCELL\n\nDIRECTOR ‑ E‑TAILERS\n\nC.G.R.

However, please inform Ounass that this is still under discussion.

However, I would suggest adding some additional clauses to hold Ounass responsible for losses to our stock whist in their custody.\n\n \n\nProposed Contract Additions:\n\n \n\n\"16.6 Ounass shall be responsible for any loss, theft, or damage to the Products while in its possession, including but not limited to pick-up, storage, handling, and delivery. Ounass shall take all reasonable care to ensure the proper handling and safekeeping of the Products and shall be liable for any damages occurring during this period.\"",
