Obviously the GL and Umbrella do not cover only the office but the whole Level Retail Americas in case of any issue.\n\nLet me know what you think\n\nThanks\n\nEugenia\n\n \n\n*\tGeneral Liability with a limit of $1M each occurrence / $2M aggregate limit.  This includes Products Liability as well as the office premises.  General Liability based on $5M annual sales is $2,637 annually.\n*\tUmbrella:  I quoted a $4M Umbrella limit which would bring your total liability coverage up to $5M each occurrence / $6M aggregate limit.  The lease does NOT require you to have an Umbrella.  But we do recommend it.  Annual cost is $1,344.\n*\tTax is $47.79 if you purchase both.

Premium Analysis & Recommendations:\n\nCoverage\n\nQuoted Premium\n\nRecommendation\n\nGL $1M/$2M\n\n$2,637\n\nQuoted premium is very high, given that fashion items carry minimal product liability risk and the turnover assumption ($5M) may not be realized. Recommend requesting a revision of the premium down to USD 1,000-1,500.\n\nProperty $50K (no windstorm)\n\n$860",

Recommend requesting a requote. \n*\tIf the landlord agrees to waive this requirement, suggest self-insuring due to minimal exposure.\n*\tOtherwise, a premium around USD 300-400 could be accepted just as a policy minimum premium.\n\nUmbrella $4M\n\n$1,344\n\nUmbrella coverage is not necessary; base coverage sufficiently addresses current exposure.\n\nRemain at your disposal should you require any further assistance on the matter and wish you the best of luck with promoting and growing the Level brand in the US.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nHagop\n\n \n\nHAGOP GHAZARIAN\n\nSPECIALIST ‑ ADMINISTRATION\n\nM.C.T.

General Liability covers the entire business operations, not just the office.",
