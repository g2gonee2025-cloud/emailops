Seven42 will be responsible if CG lost the security deposit at MOTF due to venue damages\n\n2. Seven42 to provide public and product liability insurance\n\n3. Seven42 to provide worker compensation insurance\n\n \n\n \n\nAnd below is his response:\n\n \n\n“Regarding the security deposit clause, this typically falls under the responsibility of each supplier.

Their individual contracts include clauses holding them accountable for any damage incurred due to their own negligence, not the planning agency.\n\n \n\nAs for insurance, this is usually provided by the client or by the venue itself. That said, we can look into obtaining an event-specific insurance policy should MOTF or CG be unable to provide one, but please note that this would be charged separately depending on the provider and the terms.\n\n \n\nWith respect to workers’ compensation insurance, Seven42 remains responsible for our internal team. However, this clause would be included in the contracts signed with each individual supplier, who in turn are responsible for their own crew and staff. If there’s a specific waiver or form you’d like us to share with suppliers, we’re more than happy to do so.”\n\n \n\nCan you please advise on how we can handle this?

Seven42 will be responsible if CG lost the security deposit at MOTF due to venue damages\n\n2. Seven42 to provide public and product liability insurance\n\n3. Seven42 to provide worker compensation insurance\n\n \n\n \n\nAnd below is his response:\n\n \n\n“Regarding the security deposit clause, this typically falls under the responsibility of each supplier. Their individual contracts include clauses holding them accountable for any damage incurred due to their own negligence, not the planning agency.",

Their individual contracts include clauses holding them accountable for any damage incurred due to their own negligence, not the planning agency.\n\n \n\nAs for insurance, this is usually provided by the client or by the venue itself. That said, we can look into obtaining an event-specific insurance policy should MOTF or CG be unable to provide one, but please note that this would be charged separately depending on the provider and the terms.\n\n \n\nWith respect to workers’ compensation insurance, Seven42 remains responsible for our internal team. However, this clause would be included in the contracts signed with each individual supplier, who in turn are responsible for their own crew and staff. If there’s a specific waiver or form you’d like us to share with suppliers, we’re more than happy to do so.”\n\n \n\nCan you please advise on how we can handle this? I’m not entirely sure how to proceed with this and if this is a fair ask from either party.\n\n \n\nKind regards,\n\nNINA SAMIN\n\nSENIOR ASSOCIATE ‑ BRANDING & SOCIAL\n\nM.C.T.

Seven42 will be responsible if CG lost the security deposit at MOTF due to venue damages\n\n2. Seven42 to provide public and product liability insurance\n\n3. Seven42 to provide worker compensation insurance\n\n \n\n \n\nAnd below is his response:\n\n \n\n“Regarding the security deposit clause, this typically falls under the responsibility of each supplier.

That said, we can look into obtaining an event-specific insurance policy should MOTF or CG be unable to provide one, but please note that this would be charged separately depending on the provider and the terms.\n\n \n\nWith respect to workers’ compensation insurance, Seven42 remains responsible for our internal team. However, this clause would be included in the contracts signed with each individual supplier, who in turn are responsible for their own crew and staff. If there’s a specific waiver or form you’d like us to share with suppliers, we’re more than happy to do so.”\n\n \n\nCan you please advise on how we can handle this?

Any necessary adaptations to the insurance provisions, particularly regarding coverage, should also be made.\n\n \n\nOnce all points are confirmed and updated from your side, and you are satisfied with the scope from a commercial and operational perspective, you may share the document with the vendor so we can finalize it at the earliest.\n\n \n\nBest, \n\nDana \n\n \n\nDANA MAHDI\n\n​​​​\n\nCOUNSEL ‑ LEGAL\n\nM.C.T.

Seven42 will be responsible if CG lost the security deposit at MOTF due to venue damages\n\n2. Seven42 to provide public and product liability insurance\n\n3. Seven42 to provide worker compensation insurance\n\n \n\n \n\nAnd below is his response:\n\n \n\n“Regarding the security deposit clause, this typically falls under the responsibility of each supplier. Their individual contracts include clauses holding them accountable for any damage incurred due to their own negligence, not the planning agency.",

Their individual contracts include clauses holding them accountable for any damage incurred due to their own negligence, not the planning agency.\n\n \n\nAs for insurance, this is usually provided by the client or by the venue itself. That said, we can look into obtaining an event-specific insurance policy should MOTF or CG be unable to provide one, but please note that this would be charged separately depending on the provider and the terms.\n\n \n\nWith respect to workers’ compensation insurance, Seven42 remains responsible for our internal team. However, this clause would be included in the contracts signed with each individual supplier, who in turn are responsible for their own crew and staff. If there’s a specific waiver or form you’d like us to share with suppliers, we’re more than happy to do so.”\n\n \n\nCan you please advise on how we can handle this? I’m not entirely sure how to proceed with this and if this is a fair ask from either party.\n\n \n\nKind regards,\n\nNINA SAMIN\n\nSENIOR ASSOCIATE ‑ BRANDING & SOCIAL\n\nM.C.T.

As for the payment milestones, we don’t have them specified as for now which is why we aren’t including them in the contact. That is primary because we are working with a bunch of other subcontractors (through the agency) and we cant confirm their quotes yet.\n\n \n\nIf you’re good with this version of the contract, I can add the effective date and share it back with George, from seven42.\n\n \n\nThank you,",

Any necessary adaptations to the insurance provisions, particularly regarding coverage, should also be made.\n\n \n\nOnce all points are confirmed and updated from your side, and you are satisfied with the scope from a commercial and operational perspective, you may share the document with the vendor so we can finalize it at the earliest.\n\n \n\nBest,\n\nDana\n\n \n\nDANA MAHDI\n\n​​​​\n\nCOUNSEL ‑ LEGAL\n\nM.C.T.
