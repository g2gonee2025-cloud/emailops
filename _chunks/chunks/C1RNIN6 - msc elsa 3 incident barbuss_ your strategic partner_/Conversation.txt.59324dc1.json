On May 24, 2025, this Liberian-flagged vessel, which was 28 years old and 184m long, capsized and sank approximately 38 nautical miles southwest of Kochi. The incident occurred while the ship was on its way from Vizhinjam to the port of Cochin.\n\nThe MSC Elsa 3, carrying 640 containers (13 of which contained hazardous cargo) and over 450 metric tonnes of marine fuel, began listing severely to starboard early on Saturday, issuing a distress call at 08:00 UTC with a reported 26-degree list. The Indian Navy and Coast Guard swiftly responded, rescuing 21 crew members on Saturday and the remaining three early Sunday as conditions deteriorated.\n\nThe vessel eventually capsized and sank on Sunday morning, approximately 14.6 nautical miles offshore.\n\nThis incident involving containers falling into the Arabian Sea has prompted an environmental response. It's estimated that over 100 containers entered the water, with at least 25 currently adrift. These containers are moving at approximately 3 km/h in the direction of Kerala's coastal districts, specifically Alappuzha, Kollam, Ernakulam, and Thiruvananthapuram.\n\nA few of the containers are known to contain calcium carbide, and coastal communities have been alerted as a precaution. Some containers have already reached the shore, and efforts are underway to confirm the total number.",
