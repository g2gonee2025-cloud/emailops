Given our size and scale and the number of incidents we handle a year (over 3,000), we are able to achieve preferential rates with our vendors as it is in our interest to keep incident response costs and legal costs down just as much as it is the insureds.\n\n \n\nOver the last few years, the average time we have seen for insureds to be fully recovered following a ransomware event is roughly 3 weeks, indicating the type of losses we usually cover. For clients such as Chalhoub, the intends of the policy is to pick up large, sustained events which can impact them for weeks.”\n\n \n\nUnquote \n\n \n\nTrust these are as per your requirements, and we look forward to hearing from you. \n\n \n\nThanks and regards,\n\n \n\nAshok Peter Eapen Dip CII, FRM\n\nRegional Director, General Insurance (Financial Lines & Engineering)\n\n\n\n\n\nNasco Middle East\nP.O.
