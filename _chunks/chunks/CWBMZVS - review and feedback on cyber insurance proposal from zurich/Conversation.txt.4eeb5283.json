Below, I have outlined key issues, gaps, and potential areas for contestation from an information security business perspective:\n\nKey Coverage Issues and Gaps\n\n1.\tLimitations on First Party Coverage (CyberWall)​:\n\n\t*\tIndemnity limits on business interruption, expenses, and cyber extortion are capped at 50% of the policy limit, potentially leaving significant residual risk uncovered.\n\t*\tNo coverage for system betterment or enhancements post-breach unless the original components are unavailable.\n\n2.\tExclusions That Limit Coverage Scope​:\n\n\t*\tIntentional Acts: Excludes events caused by wilful misconduct of high-level executives, which could create challenges in disputes over accountability.\n\t*\tExternal Infrastructure: No coverage for unavailability of third-party infrastructure like cloud providers unless related to data breaches, which is a critical dependency in modern IT ecosystems.\n\n3.\tIncident Response and Loss Recovery Gaps​:",

This threshold may leave significant acquisitions uncovered.\n\t*\tApproval Delays: Larger acquisitions require insurer approval, risking delays, and potential coverage gaps during critical early stages of integration.\n\t*\tNo Retroactive Coverage: Coverage applies only to events occurring after the acquisition, leaving inherited cybersecurity liabilities unaddressed.\n\n6.\tRegulatory Compliance and Legal Assistance​​:\n\n\t*\tLegal assistance sub-limits may not cover extensive cross-border disputes or large-scale regulatory investigations.\n\t*\tLimited provisions for pre-emptive regulatory risk assessments or assistance with evolving international regulations.\n\n7.\tReputation and Brand Damage​:\n\n\t*\tCrisis communication and reputation recovery provisions have limited sub-limits, potentially leaving significant brand recovery efforts underfunded.\n\n8.\tCybersecurity Standards and Controls​:",

Unfortunately, Nasco has not been able to secure concrete terms at this time, so I cannot recommend their proposal.\n\nAs such, Zurich’s proposal is the only viable proposal at this point, accepting the Chalhoub Risk profile on an as-is basis with no technical subjectivities.\n\nBelow, I have outlined the key details of the proposal for your consideration and feedback:\n\n________________________________\n\nProposal Summary\n\n \n\nAspect\n\nDetails\n\nInsurance Provider\n\nZurich (100%)\n\nAnnual Aggregate Limit\n\nUSD 5,000,000\n\nRetention (Per Loss)\n\nUSD 500,000\n\nAnnual Premium\n\nUSD 350,000 (excl. fees & VAT)\n\nWaiting Period\n\n18 hours\n\nPolicy Wording\n\nMarsh CyberWall / Zurich\n\nRetroactive Date\n\nInception\n\nIncident Response Vendor\n\nClyde & Co\n\n________________________________\n\nCoverage Details",

However, any attack necessitating a replacement for hardware such as a compromised server for example, the replacement should be of a similar level of technological sophistication which would have been considered at the time of setup. (mid-level system at time of creation should be replaced by a mid-level system at time of replacements following an insured event.

Note that the malicious damage in only limited to C-level executives, it does not exclude malicious damage caused by employees and the exclusion applies only if the act is proven through a final non-appealable adjudication or a written admission.

If new entities acquired or merged with exceed 25% the parent company’s consolidated assets or revenue, insurers must review that entity’s risk before extending coverage. 25% of the parent company represents a merger or acquisition of a company with net assets or total revenue in excess of USD 500M. It would be a material change in the risk profile and the insurer has the right to study the risk.\n\n \n\nNo Retroactive Coverage: Coverage applies only to events occurring after the acquisition, leaving inherited cybersecurity liabilities unaddressed.\n\n \n\nFor acquired entities, coverage cannot stretch back for incidents that occurred before the acquisition date. We can try to push for a retroactive date but it would definitely exclude known incidents that have not be properly resolved.\n\n6.\tRegulatory Compliance and Legal Assistance​​:\n\n\t*\tLegal assistance sub-limits may not cover extensive cross-border disputes or large-scale regulatory investigations.\n\nCurrently, legal expenses for cross-border or large-scale investigations are sublimited at 50% which is USD 2,500,000 out of the policy maximum aggregate limit of USD 5M which is reasonable.\n\n\t*\tLimited provisions for pre-emptive regulatory risk assessments or assistance with evolving international regulations.\n\nPre-emptive risk assessment is the responsibility of the insured, not the insurer. The insurer is responsible for incident response only. If this is relating to professional fees post an incident, we can get it covered.\n\n7.\tReputation and Brand Damage​:",

Below, I have outlined key issues, gaps, and potential areas for contestation from an information security business perspective:\n\nKey Coverage Issues and Gaps\n\n1.\tLimitations on First Party Coverage (CyberWall)​:\n\n\t*\tIndemnity limits on business interruption, expenses, and cyber extortion are capped at 50% of the policy limit, potentially leaving significant residual risk uncovered.\n\t*\tNo coverage for system betterment or enhancements post-breach unless the original components are unavailable.",

As such, certain limitations in cover are expected. As advised in the e-mail trail, once full MFA is in place, we can increase the coverage limit for all categories up to USD 10M at no change in premium. That beings said, the aggregate limit is still USD 5,000,000. As such, even though some specific categories are capped, the losses relating to the different categories are additive\n\nSystem Betterment: Betterment is generally excluded in cyber insurance, but it may be possible to negotiate a small sublimit (~USD 50k). However, any attack necessitating a replacement for hardware such as a compromised server for example, the replacement should be of a similar level of technological sophistication which would have been considered at the time of setup. (mid-level system at time of creation should be replaced by a mid-level system at time of replacements following an insured event. Anything above that would have to be paid out of pocket)\n\n2.\tExclusions That Limit Coverage Scope​:",

However, any attack necessitating a replacement for hardware such as a compromised server for example, the replacement should be of a similar level of technological sophistication which would have been considered at the time of setup. (mid-level system at time of creation should be replaced by a mid-level system at time of replacements following an insured event.

I hope 2025 is off to a great start for you.\n\n \n\nI’m following up on the Zurich Cyber Insurance proposal I shared earlier and would appreciate your feedback. Once I have your input, I can move forward with requesting the final quotation and full policy wording from the broker. If there’s anything specific you’d like me to clarify or request from them, please let me know.\n\n \n\nIt would also be helpful to understand your targets for MFA implementation—at least for UAE and KSA, and ideally for Kuwait as well. This input will help us coordinate potential improvements to the policy, such as increasing the overall limit, improving the sublimits on reduced covers, and reducing the policy excess to around USD 250,000.\n\n \n\nLet us aim to have the cover in place by the end of the month to establish a base level of insurance protection, and we can work on enhancing the policy limits and covers as our risk profile strengthens.\n\n \n\nThank you for your time and support. I look forward to your thoughts.\n\n \n\nBest regards,\n\nHagop\n\n \n\nHAGOP GHAZARIAN​​​​\n\nSPECIALIST ‑ ADMINISTRATION\n\nM.C.T. FZE\n\nDUBAI\n\n‑\n\nUNITED ARAB EMIRATES\n\n+971 4 8045000",
