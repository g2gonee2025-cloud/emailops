An investigation was conducted in the warehouse and among other captains to determine if these orders were misplaced during dispatch; however, they remained unaccounted for until the next day. When loading the vehicle the following day, a small hole was discovered below the door handle, raising suspicions that a theft had indeed taken place by unlocking the side door handle in a professional manner, without leaving much visible traces.\n\n \n\nA police complaint has been filed, but due to staff unavailability yesterday because of Eid, the captain is scheduled to meet with them today at 3:30 PM.

An investigation was conducted in the warehouse and among other captains to determine if these orders were misplaced during dispatch; however, they remained unaccounted for until the next day. When loading the vehicle the following day, a small hole was discovered below the door handle, raising suspicions that a theft had indeed taken place by unlocking the side door handle in a professional manner, without leaving much visible traces.\n\n \n\nA police complaint has been filed, but due to staff unavailability yesterday because of Eid, the captain is scheduled to meet with them today at 3:30 PM.
