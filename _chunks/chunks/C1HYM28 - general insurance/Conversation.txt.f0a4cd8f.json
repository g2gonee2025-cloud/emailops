For a Tender which has a significant value in terms of coverage and cost , needs sufficient time for all parties involved to assess , negotiate and have an agreement put in place. Hence we need to agree on a deadline for a decision to be taken and work backwards giving all parties involved sufficient time to run a thorough and effective Tender Process. It is important to note that the contract management process does take on an average two weeks to complete . So a decision has to be taken minimum two weeks prior to the deadline date .",

I doubt this will happen, but it's important to have a backup plan.\nFinally, for the contract management element, we do not need to wait for the full policies. We only need a confirmation of cover, which can usually be obtained in 2-3 working days.\nPlease note that we cannot trade without a renewed policy. I will do my best to manage within this timeframe. If, after the work is completed, you have legitimate and real concerns, we can explore extending the policy for one month to allow more time. However, this is a decision that can be made later should the need arise.\nBest to connect during next week to align on the process as Joe will be back from his leave also.\nBest Regards,\nHagop\n________________________________\n\nFrom: Vishal Noronha <Vishal.Noronha@chalhoub.com>\nSent: Friday, August 08, 2025 9:42 AM\nTo: Hagop Ghazarian <Hagop.Ghazarian@chalhoub.com>\nCc: Joe Hobeika <Joe.Hobeika@chalhoub.com>; Sangeetha Abraham <Sangeetha.Abraham@chalhoub.com>\nSubject: RE: General Insurance",

For a Tender which has a significant value in terms of coverage and cost , needs sufficient time for all parties involved to assess , negotiate and have an agreement put in place. Hence we need to agree on a deadline for a decision to be taken and work backwards giving all parties involved sufficient time to run a thorough and effective Tender Process. It is important to note that the contract management process does take on an average two weeks to complete . So a decision has to be taken minimum two weeks prior to the deadline date .\n\n \n\nWith reference to the list of Insurance brokers can you share some light on why we have selected the below three brokers.\n\n \n\nSangeetha and I are both on leave starting today and will be back in office on 18th Aug (Sangeetha ) and 25th Aug (Vishal) .\n\n \n\nI am happy to get onto a call today to talk through your email and my feedback.\n\n \n\nThanks\nVishal\n\n \n\nVISHAL NORONHA\n​​​​\nVP ‑ PROCUREMENT\nM.C.T.

The decision to appoint a single broker must be justified with a clear business reason else we need to go through the Tender process of inviting a minimum 3 suppliers . I am attaching the Procurement Policy . This was approved on 28 June by myself ,  our Group CEO and CFO . Though we have postponed the re-  launch of the policy the expectation is to have it followed. Please do not share this document onward with any team member until it is officially communicated through my office. This is just as a FYI . \n\n \n\nWe would also not recommend proceeding without a signed agreement . No supplier engagement must take place without this being the case. Legal will question if it is made known that we are engaging a supplier without a signed agreement. Exceptions to this process must be discussed , agreed and approved by Joe and myself. \n\n \n\nHence I suggest you meet with Sonia and Gidgette next week and talk through the process and agree on taking the right steps to ensure compliance . \n\n \n\nAs per our WoW , we ensure the category owners , which in this case is yourself and Joe , will be actively involved in the process and no decision will be taken without your input.",

I doubt this will happen, but it's important to have a backup plan.\n\nFinally, for the contract management element, we do not need to wait for the full policies. We only need a confirmation of cover, which can usually be obtained in 2-3 working days.\n\nPlease note that we cannot trade without a renewed policy. I will do my best to manage within this timeframe. If, after the work is completed, you have legitimate and real concerns, we can explore extending the policy for one month to allow more time.",

There will be two brokers competing for the business and potentially a third for KSA.\n\n \n\nFurthermore, note that the insurance broker will be approaching multiple insurers with guidelines set to avoid overlapping access to the same insurer.\n\n \n\nRegarding policy issuance, it takes considerable time for compliance checks to be made and approved, as this needs to be done for all insured entities region-wide. There is a lengthy KYC and UBO declaration required that tends to cause delays. This is a requirement mandated by the Central Bank in the UAE, the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority (SAMA) in KSA, and so on. As such, a firm order from our end, followed by a bound cover confirmation from the insurer, legally binds the contract. Unlike conventional agreements, insurance contracts are no longer signed and returned as was previously the case. This does not mean we operate without documentation; accounts do not pay without supporting details, and we have an internal audit done on a yearly basis.\n\n \n\nPlease understand that this is a group-wide tender involving multiple classes of insurance. I cannot just give you a list of requirements and leave the rest to you. There are technical elements, a deep understanding of the operational structure, and processes necessary, and which must be conveyed properly for accurate risk profiling; this is non-negotiable.",

However, please note that the framework is already well-structured and although the numbers are big, the risk profile is to a large extent uniform. The market is also quite familiar with our portfolio as they have been involved in either quoting, insuring, or reinsuring it previously.\n\nRegarding the brokers, Marsh is the largest broker globally, and they have been performing well. As for Aon, they are a potential stand-in for the KSA tender only. They are the second largest broker globally, and the KSA team has expressed dissatisfaction with their current service level with the existing setup.

For a Tender which has a significant value in terms of coverage and cost , needs sufficient time for all parties involved to assess , negotiate and have an agreement put in place. Hence we need to agree on a deadline for a decision to be taken and work backwards giving all parties involved sufficient time to run a thorough and effective Tender Process. It is important to note that the contract management process does take on an average two weeks to complete . So a decision has to be taken minimum two weeks prior to the deadline date .\n\n \n\nWith reference to the list of Insurance brokers can you share some light on why we have selected the below three brokers.\n\n \n\nSangeetha and I are both on leave starting today and will be back in office on 18th Aug (Sangeetha ) and 25th Aug (Vishal) .\n\n \n\nI am happy to get onto a call today to talk through your email and my feedback.\n\n \n\nThanks\nVishal\n\n \n\nVISHAL NORONHA\n\n​​​​\n\nVP ‑ PROCUREMENT\n\nM.C.T.

As such, a firm order from our end, followed by a bound cover confirmation from the insurer, legally binds the contract.

They are the second largest broker globally, and the KSA team has expressed dissatisfaction with their current service level with the existing setup. If they request to disqualify their current broker, Aon would be a suitable replacement to maintain a competitive environment. We have good previous working relationships with key contacts on the Aon Saudi team, so they would be a logical choice. I doubt this will happen, but it's important to have a backup plan.\n\nFinally, for the contract management element, we do not need to wait for the full policies. We only need a confirmation of cover, which can usually be obtained in 2-3 working days.\n\nPlease note that we cannot trade without a renewed policy. I will do my best to manage within this timeframe. If, after the work is completed, you have legitimate and real concerns, we can explore extending the policy for one month to allow more time. However, this is a decision that can be made later should the need arise.\n\nBest to connect during next week to align on the process as Joe will be back from his leave also.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nHagop\n\nHAGOP GHAZARIAN\n\n​​​​\n\nSPECIALIST ‑ ADMINISTRATION\n\nM.C.T.

For a Tender which has a significant value in terms of coverage and cost , needs sufficient time for all parties involved to assess , negotiate and have an agreement put in place. Hence we need to agree on a deadline for a decision to be taken and work backwards giving all parties involved sufficient time to run a thorough and effective Tender Process. It is important to note that the contract management process does take on an average two weeks to complete . So a decision has to be taken minimum two weeks prior to the deadline date .\n\n \n\nWith reference to the list of Insurance brokers can you share some light on why we have selected the below three brokers.\n\n \n\nSangeetha and I are both on leave starting today and will be back in office on 18th Aug (Sangeetha ) and 25th Aug (Vishal) .\n\n \n\nI am happy to get onto a call today to talk through your email and my feedback.",

This is a requirement mandated by the Central Bank in the UAE, the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority (SAMA) in KSA, and so on. As such, a firm order from our end, followed by a bound cover confirmation from the insurer, legally binds the contract. Unlike conventional agreements, insurance contracts are no longer signed and returned as was previously the case. This does not mean we operate without documentation; accounts do not pay without supporting details, and we have an internal audit done on a yearly basis.\n\n \n\nPlease understand that this is a group-wide tender involving multiple classes of insurance.

However, please note that the framework is already well-structured and although the numbers are big, the risk profile is to a large extent uniform. The market is also quite familiar with our portfolio as they have been involved in either quoting, insuring, or reinsuring it previously.\n\nRegarding the brokers, Marsh is the largest broker globally, and they have been performing well.",

      "text": "Regarding the brokers, Marsh is the largest broker globally, and they have been performing well. As for Aon, they are a potential stand-in for the KSA tender only. They are the second largest broker globally, and the KSA team has expressed dissatisfaction with their current service level with the existing setup. If they request to disqualify their current broker, Aon would be a suitable replacement to maintain a competitive environment. We have good previous working relationships with key contacts on the Aon Saudi team, so they would be a logical choice. I doubt this will happen, but it's important to have a backup plan.\n\nFinally, for the contract management element, we do not need to wait for the full policies. We only need a confirmation of cover, which can usually be obtained in 2-3 working days.\n\nPlease note that we cannot trade without a renewed policy. I will do my best to manage within this timeframe. If, after the work is completed, you have legitimate and real concerns, we can explore extending the policy for one month to allow more time. However, this is a decision that can be made later should the need arise.\n\nBest to connect during next week to align on the process as Joe will be back from his leave also.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nHagop\n\nHAGOP GHAZARIAN\n\n​​​​\n\nSPECIALIST ‑ ADMINISTRATION\n\nM.C.T.
