The current situation presents a risk level that is beyond our control and cannot be tolerated any longer.\n\n \n\nAs confirmed today with Hagop, as the facility is operating without Civil Defence certificates, so it is not covered by the insurance policy. This exposes us to significant risks — to our team members, stock, and the facility itself.

It has quiet been some time since Rawad raised it, and unfortunately, we have not received any updates on the status of this vital matter, nor has a clear timeline for completion been provided.\n\n \n\nWith the current risk assessment and weather forecasts for this year, we are anticipating higher-than-usual temperatures, which significantly increase the risk of fire incidents in warehousing facilities globally. This is a serious concern that we cannot afford to overlook.\n\n \n\nAs of now, our facility remains unconnected to Civil Defence, which poses a serious risk by potentially delaying emergency response in the event of a fire. Additionally, from a compliance standpoint, we remain in a non-compliant status, which could lead to fines or other regulatory actions should there be an inspection. This is an issue that we need to address urgently to ensure the safety of our team, assets, and overall operations.\n\n \n\nWe are keen to support the resolution of this issue in any way we can. Your guidance on the next steps and a clear timeline for resolution would be greatly appreciated.
