We recommend negotiating a higher liability cap or securing carve-outs in case of stock loss, operational failures, or gross negligence.\n\n \n\n*\tDeposit and Lien: They request a deposit equivalent to two months of shipping costs and retain a broad lien over our goods, including the right to block or sell goods in case of unpaid invoices. We suggest negotiating a formal notice period and safeguards before any exercise of retention or sale rights.\n\n \n\n*\tPrice Changes: The agreement allows for unilateral price changes with only 30 days’ notice (and pandemic surcharges with just 24 hours’ notice). We recommend negotiating a longer notice period (e.g., 60 days) and, if possible, setting a reasonable annual cap on increases.\n\n \n\n*\tTermination: The 6-month minimum term is acceptable, but we suggest ensuring that we have the right to terminate immediately in the event of material breaches, operational failures, or risks to our stock.",

They should remain liable for any damages caused by their negligence or operational errors. Additionally, we would appreciate your advice on what level and type of warehouse insurance coverage would typically be considered standard if we were operating our own warehouse, so we can better benchmark what is reasonable to expect from the 3PL provider and where we may need to secure additional protection independently.\n\n \n\n*\tCustomer Shipping Protection: We are considering offering optional customer shipping protection at checkout (such as Route), although this has not yet been finalized.

We recommend negotiating a higher liability cap or securing carve-outs in case of stock loss, operational failures, or gross negligence.",

We recommend negotiating a higher liability cap or securing carve-outs in case of stock loss, operational failures, or gross negligence.\n\n \n\n*\tDeposit and Lien: They request a deposit equivalent to two months of shipping costs and retain a broad lien over our goods, including the right to block or sell goods in case of unpaid invoices. We suggest negotiating a formal notice period and safeguards before any exercise of retention or sale rights.\n\n \n\n*\tPrice Changes: The agreement allows for unilateral price changes with only 30 days’ notice (and pandemic surcharges with just 24 hours’ notice). We recommend negotiating a longer notice period (e.g., 60 days) and, if possible, setting a reasonable annual cap on increases.\n\n \n\n*\tTermination: The 6-month minimum term is acceptable, but we suggest ensuring that we have the right to terminate immediately in the event of material breaches, operational failures, or risks to our stock.",

      "text": "*\tTermination: The 6-month minimum term is acceptable, but we suggest ensuring that we have the right to terminate immediately in the event of material breaches, operational failures, or risks to our stock.\n\n \n\n*\tInsurance: While we plan to independently insure our inventory via Shopify's recommended partner (Assureful) or an equivalent provider, we recommend clarifying that Salesupply must also carry basic operational warehouse insurance. They should remain liable for any damages caused by their negligence or operational errors. Additionally, we would appreciate your advice on what level and type of warehouse insurance coverage would typically be considered standard if we were operating our own warehouse, so we can better benchmark what is reasonable to expect from the 3PL provider and where we may need to secure additional protection independently.\n\n \n\n*\tCustomer Shipping Protection: We are considering offering optional customer shipping protection at checkout (such as Route), although this has not yet been finalized. (No need to refer to this part this is just added information I am putting here for all of us to have visibility, this is unrelated to them)\n\n \n\n*\tSEPA Direct Debit Authorization: The contract requires automatic SEPA direct debit for invoice payments. We would prefer to retain control by paying manually via bank transfer against a standard 14-day payment term after invoice issuance. Please confirm if we can request this adjustment, as it aligns better with standard B2B practices and ensures appropriate oversight of payments.",

We recommend negotiating a higher liability cap or securing carve-outs in case of stock loss, operational failures, or gross negligence.",

We recommend negotiating a higher liability cap or securing carve-outs in case of stock loss, operational failures, or gross negligence.\n\n \n\n*\tDeposit and Lien: They request a deposit equivalent to two months of shipping costs and retain a broad lien over our goods, including the right to block or sell goods in case of unpaid invoices. We suggest negotiating a formal notice period and safeguards before any exercise of retention or sale rights.\n\n \n\n*\tPrice Changes: The agreement allows for unilateral price changes with only 30 days’ notice (and pandemic surcharges with just 24 hours’ notice). We recommend negotiating a longer notice period (e.g., 60 days) and, if possible, setting a reasonable annual cap on increases.\n\n \n\n*\tTermination: The 6-month minimum term is acceptable, but we suggest ensuring that we have the right to terminate immediately in the event of material breaches, operational failures, or risks to our stock.",

They should remain liable for any damages caused by their negligence or operational errors. Additionally, we would appreciate your advice on what level and type of warehouse insurance coverage would typically be considered standard if we were operating our own warehouse, so we can better benchmark what is reasonable to expect from the 3PL provider and where we may need to secure additional protection independently.\n\n \n\n*\tCustomer Shipping Protection: We are considering offering optional customer shipping protection at checkout (such as Route), although this has not yet been finalized. (No need to refer to this part this is just added information I am putting here for all of us to have visibility, this is unrelated to them)\n\n \n\n*\tSEPA Direct Debit Authorization: The contract requires automatic SEPA direct debit for invoice payments. We would prefer to retain control by paying manually via bank transfer against a standard 14-day payment term after invoice issuance. Please confirm if we can request this adjustment, as it aligns better with standard B2B practices and ensures appropriate oversight of payments.",

We suggest negotiating a cap on these costs or agreeing in advance on a clear exit plan to avoid unpredictable charges.\n\n \n\n*\tGoverning Law: The agreement is governed by Italian law, with disputes handled in either Varese or Milan. We recommend, if possible, requesting jurisdiction to be limited to Milan courts only, for consistency and simplicity.\n\n \n\nPlease let us know your thoughts and recommendations.\n\n \n\nKind regards,\n\n \n\nANA CANADAS​​​​\n\nDIRECTOR ‑ INNOVATION\n\nC.G.R.

We recommend negotiating a higher liability cap or securing carve-outs in case of stock loss, operational failures, or gross negligence.",

We recommend negotiating a higher liability cap or securing carve-outs in case of stock loss, operational failures, or gross negligence.\n\n \n\n*\tDeposit and Lien: They request a deposit equivalent to two months of shipping costs and retain a broad lien over our goods, including the right to block or sell goods in case of unpaid invoices. We suggest negotiating a formal notice period and safeguards before any exercise of retention or sale rights.\n\n \n\n*\tPrice Changes: The agreement allows for unilateral price changes with only 30 days’ notice (and pandemic surcharges with just 24 hours’ notice). We recommend negotiating a longer notice period (e.g., 60 days) and, if possible, setting a reasonable annual cap on increases.\n\n \n\n*\tTermination: The 6-month minimum term is acceptable, but we suggest ensuring that we have the right to terminate immediately in the event of material breaches, operational failures, or risks to our stock.",

They should remain liable for any damages caused by their negligence or operational errors. Additionally, we would appreciate your advice on what level and type of warehouse insurance coverage would typically be considered standard if we were operating our own warehouse, so we can better benchmark what is reasonable to expect from the 3PL provider and where we may need to secure additional protection independently.\n\n \n\n*\tCustomer Shipping Protection: We are considering offering optional customer shipping protection at checkout (such as Route), although this has not yet been finalized. (No need to refer to this part this is just added information I am putting here for all of us to have visibility, this is unrelated to them)\n\n \n\n*\tSEPA Direct Debit Authorization: The contract requires automatic SEPA direct debit for invoice payments. We would prefer to retain control by paying manually via bank transfer against a standard 14-day payment term after invoice issuance. Please confirm if we can request this adjustment, as it aligns better with standard B2B practices and ensures appropriate oversight of payments.",

Please confirm if we can request this adjustment, as it aligns better with standard B2B practices and ensures appropriate oversight of payments.\n\n \n\n*\tGDPR Compliance: The data processing terms seem generally aligned with GDPR requirements, but we would appreciate your confirmation that they are sufficient for our current and future operational scope, particularly regarding the handling of customer personal data.\n\n \n\n*\tExit Terms: The agreement allows them to charge hourly fees for exit support and stock transition. We suggest negotiating a cap on these costs or agreeing in advance on a clear exit plan to avoid unpredictable charges.\n\n \n\n*\tGoverning Law: The agreement is governed by Italian law, with disputes handled in either Varese or Milan. We recommend, if possible, requesting jurisdiction to be limited to Milan courts only, for consistency and simplicity.\n\n \n\nPlease let us know your thoughts and recommendations.\n\n \n\nKind regards,\n\n \n\nANA CANADAS​​​​\n\nDIRECTOR ‑ INNOVATION\n\nC.G.R.

We recommend negotiating a higher liability cap or securing carve-outs in case of stock loss, operational failures, or gross negligence.\n\n \n\n*\tDeposit and Lien: They request a deposit equivalent to two months of shipping costs and retain a broad lien over our goods, including the right to block or sell goods in case of unpaid invoices. We suggest negotiating a formal notice period and safeguards before any exercise of retention or sale rights.\n\n \n\n*\tPrice Changes: The agreement allows for unilateral price changes with only 30 days’ notice (and pandemic surcharges with just 24 hours’ notice). We recommend negotiating a longer notice period (e.g., 60 days) and, if possible, setting a reasonable annual cap on increases.\n\n \n\n*\tTermination: The 6-month minimum term is acceptable, but we suggest ensuring that we have the right to terminate immediately in the event of material breaches, operational failures, or risks to our stock.",

They should remain liable for any damages caused by their negligence or operational errors. Additionally, we would appreciate your advice on what level and type of warehouse insurance coverage would typically be considered standard if we were operating our own warehouse, so we can better benchmark what is reasonable to expect from the 3PL provider and where we may need to secure additional protection independently.\n\n \n\n*\tCustomer Shipping Protection: We are considering offering optional customer shipping protection at checkout (such as Route), although this has not yet been finalized. (No need to refer to this part this is just added information I am putting here for all of us to have visibility, this is unrelated to them)\n\n \n\n*\tSEPA Direct Debit Authorization: The contract requires automatic SEPA direct debit for invoice payments. We would prefer to retain control by paying manually via bank transfer against a standard 14-day payment term after invoice issuance. Please confirm if we can request this adjustment, as it aligns better with standard B2B practices and ensures appropriate oversight of payments.",

We suggest negotiating a cap on these costs or agreeing in advance on a clear exit plan to avoid unpredictable charges.\n\n \n\n*\tGoverning Law: The agreement is governed by Italian law, with disputes handled in either Varese or Milan.
