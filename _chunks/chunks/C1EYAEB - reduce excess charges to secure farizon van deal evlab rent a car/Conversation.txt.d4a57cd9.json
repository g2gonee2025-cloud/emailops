As discussed, it’s critical for us to partner with providers that allow us the flexibility and support required to remain competitive in the EV leasing segment.\n\nUnfortunately, with GIG, the prevailing restrictions—be it exceptionally high premiums or excessive excess charges—are making it difficult for us to offer attractive leasing packages to our clients.\n\nAs agreed, please reconnect with the insurance companies and share their feedback with us at your earliest convenience. We can’t afford to lose business opportunities due to uncompetitive terms, and I’m confident you share this perspective.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\n\nBest regards,\n\nJackie Merchant \n\nEV Leasing & Rental\n\n+971 58 541 4500\n\n <https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1-Ddizmpxe9_kDi6uzmzWJjHqGqyKkU0f&export=download> \n\nBuilding 6, The Greenhouse\n\nDubai Design District\n\nDubai, UAE",

We have a significant last-mile fleet client ready to move forward—this deal stands to anchor our future growth in the commercial segment and could serve as a showcase for further expansion.\n\n\tAt present, the proposed excess charge of AED 5,000 per incident is a key sticking point. As you know, the reality for last-mile operators is that such charges are transferred directly to drivers, making cost sensitivity paramount. Across the market, excess levels for similar vans (valued at AED 135,000) are consistently well below AED 1,000. Our client has been explicit: unless we can match these prevailing rates, their leadership will not give final approval.It is also a powerful message of collaboration and market agility, reinforcing the trust clients place in us and our insurance partners.\n\n\tI am confident that with your expertise and NASCO’s partnership, we can find a solution that minimizes risk while unlocking these future opportunities. Your flexibility here will have a direct, measurable impact on our ability to close this deal and build long-term momentum.\n\n\tI greatly appreciate your prompt attention and am keen to hear any options or creative arrangements you might recommend to help us bring this across the finish line.\n\n\tThank you for your continued partnership.\n\n\tBest regards,\n\n\tJackie Merchant \n\n\tEV Leasing & Rental\n\n\t+971 58 541 4500\n\n\t <https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1-Ddizmpxe9_kDi6uzmzWJjHqGqyKkU0f&export=download> \n\n\tBuilding 6, The Greenhouse",

As discussed, it’s critical for us to partner with providers that allow us the flexibility and support required to remain competitive in the EV leasing segment.\n\n\tUnfortunately, with GIG, the prevailing restrictions—be it exceptionally high premiums or excessive excess charges—are making it difficult for us to offer attractive leasing packages to our clients.\n\n\tAs agreed, please reconnect with the insurance companies and share their feedback with us at your earliest convenience. We can’t afford to lose business opportunities due to uncompetitive terms, and I’m confident you share this perspective.",

We have a significant last-mile fleet client ready to move forward—this deal stands to anchor our future growth in the commercial segment and could serve as a showcase for further expansion.\n\n\t\tAt present, the proposed excess charge of AED 5,000 per incident is a key sticking point. As you know, the reality for last-mile operators is that such charges are transferred directly to drivers, making cost sensitivity paramount. Across the market, excess levels for similar vans (valued at AED 135,000) are consistently well below AED 1,000. Our client has been explicit: unless we can match these prevailing rates, their leadership will not give final approval.It is also a powerful message of collaboration and market agility, reinforcing the trust clients place in us and our insurance partners.\n\n\t\tI am confident that with your expertise and NASCO’s partnership, we can find a solution that minimizes risk while unlocking these future opportunities. Your flexibility here will have a direct, measurable impact on our ability to close this deal and build long-term momentum.\n\n\t\tI greatly appreciate your prompt attention and am keen to hear any options or creative arrangements you might recommend to help us bring this across the finish line.\n\n\t\tThank you for your continued partnership.\n\n\t\tBest regards,\n\n\t\tJackie Merchant \n\n\t\tEV Leasing & Rental\n\n\t\t+971 58 541 4500\n\n\t\t <https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1-Ddizmpxe9_kDi6uzmzWJjHqGqyKkU0f&export=download> \n\n\t\tBuilding 6, The Greenhouse",

We have a significant last-mile fleet client ready to move forward—this deal stands to anchor our future growth in the commercial segment and could serve as a showcase for further expansion.\n\n\t\tAt present, the proposed excess charge of AED 5,000 per incident is a key sticking point. As you know, the reality for last-mile operators is that such charges are transferred directly to drivers, making cost sensitivity paramount. Across the market, excess levels for similar vans (valued at AED 135,000) are consistently well below AED 1,000. Our client has been explicit: unless we can match these prevailing rates, their leadership will not give final approval.It is also a powerful message of collaboration and market agility, reinforcing the trust clients place in us and our insurance partners.\n\n\t\tI am confident that with your expertise and NASCO’s partnership, we can find a solution that minimizes risk while unlocking these future opportunities. Your flexibility here will have a direct, measurable impact on our ability to close this deal and build long-term momentum.\n\n\t\tI greatly appreciate your prompt attention and am keen to hear any options or creative arrangements you might recommend to help us bring this across the finish line.\n\n\t\tThank you for your continued partnership.\n\n\t\tBest regards,\n\n\t\tJackie Merchant \n\n\t\tEV Leasing & Rental\n\n\t\t+971 58 541 4500\n\n\t\t <https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1-Ddizmpxe9_kDi6uzmzWJjHqGqyKkU0f&export=download> \n\n\t\tBuilding 6, The Greenhouse",

We have a significant last-mile fleet client ready to move forward—this deal stands to anchor our future growth in the commercial segment and could serve as a showcase for further expansion.\n\n\t\t\tAt present, the proposed excess charge of AED 5,000 per incident is a key sticking point. As you know, the reality for last-mile operators is that such charges are transferred directly to drivers, making cost sensitivity paramount. Across the market, excess levels for similar vans (valued at AED 135,000) are consistently well below AED 1,000. Our client has been explicit: unless we can match these prevailing rates, their leadership will not give final approval.It is also a powerful message of collaboration and market agility, reinforcing the trust clients place in us and our insurance partners.\n\n\t\t\tI am confident that with your expertise and NASCO’s partnership, we can find a solution that minimizes risk while unlocking these future opportunities. Your flexibility here will have a direct, measurable impact on our ability to close this deal and build long-term momentum.\n\n\t\t\tI greatly appreciate your prompt attention and am keen to hear any options or creative arrangements you might recommend to help us bring this across the finish line.\n\n\t\t\tThank you for your continued partnership.\n\n\t\t\tBest regards,\n\n\t\t\tJackie Merchant \n\n\t\t\tEV Leasing & Rental\n\n\t\t\t+971 58 541 4500\n\n\t\t\t <https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1-Ddizmpxe9_kDi6uzmzWJjHqGqyKkU0f&export=download>",
