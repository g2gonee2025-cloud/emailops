According to these regulations, Insurance Brokers are prohibited from collecting premiums under any circumstances. These regulations will come into effect on February 15, 2025.\n\nIn compliance with these regulations, we will cease collecting premiums effective January 1, 2025. Henceforth, all premium payments should be made directly to the insurance providers as per the details mentioned in the insurance policy invoice you receive from the insurance company.\n\n \n\nA negative account balance may indicate a refund or another issue that requires clarification. Please contact our team promptly to address this issue.",
