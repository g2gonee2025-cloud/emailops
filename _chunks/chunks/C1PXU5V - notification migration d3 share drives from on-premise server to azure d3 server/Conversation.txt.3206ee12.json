This will ensure that all drives can be re-mapped to your PC once they are migrated to the new cloud server.\n\nKindly follow these instructions to check your currently mapped drives.\n\n*\tOpen File Explorer (Windows key + E).\n*\tSelect \"This PC\" in the left pane.\n*\tThe mapped network drives will be listed under \"Network\". \n*\tPlease note down the names of these drives until after the migration.",
