We understand that while our employees in various roles, functions and businesses will have varying levels of impact or connection to AI, it’s important that ALL of our teams have solid and aligned foundation, as well as remain committed to Ethical use of AI while protecting the Group privacy. This makes the course not a choice but a necessity that we, as leaders must embrace.",
