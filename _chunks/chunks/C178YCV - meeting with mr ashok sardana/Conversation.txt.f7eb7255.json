Mr. Ashok is keen to connect for a casual conversation—no set agenda, just an opportunity to meet, exchange ideas, and see if there’s common ground. This could be over coffee, at his office, or ours; whatever works best.\n\n \n\nLet me know when Mr. Chalhoub would be available, and I’d be happy to coordinate.\n\n \n\nLooking forward to hearing from you.\n\n \n\nBest regards,",

This could be over coffee, at his office, or ours; whatever works best.\n\n \n\nLet me know when Mr. Chalhoub would be available, and I’d be happy to coordinate.\n\n \n\nLooking forward to hearing from you.\n\n \n\nBest regards,",
