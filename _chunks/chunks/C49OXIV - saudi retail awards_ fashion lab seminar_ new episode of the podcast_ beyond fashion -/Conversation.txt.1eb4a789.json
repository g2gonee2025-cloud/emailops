This collaboration offers FAD students valuable real-world exposure through potential internships, live projects, and on-campus masterclasses delivered by our own talents. It’s a great way to inspire the next generation while giving them a glimpse into the world of luxury fashion. It’s also a chance to learn from their fresh perspectives and evolving mindset bringing new energy, ideas, and innovation into our teams.\n\nFor inquiries and to share your news in the Internal News please contact rasha.nashashibi@chalhoub.com <https://onechalhoub.connexionsnow.com/mtracking/linkref.php?link1id=904&user=10620>  \n\nCopyright © 2025 Chalhoub Group.
