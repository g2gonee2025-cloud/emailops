They have some quick wins and a strategic roadmap to address known gaps.\n\n2.\tMarket Submission:\n\n\t*\tDee and Yekta discussed the need to submit the current status to the market to understand who is willing to insure them and under what exclusions.",

This may mean that the policy is not worthwhile.\n\t*\tDee highlighted the importance of understanding the exclusions and whether it would be a co-insurance policy and what the business benefit is.\n\n3.\tStrategy and Funding:\n\n\t*\tDee mentioned that the strategy needs to be approved and funded to deliver year on year.  We cannot share this until it is fully approved and has been signed off. We would have to explore the market based on our current maturity status.\n\t*\tThe impact of achieving target objectives on the insurance policy was discussed, including the potential removal of restrictions and premium benefits. There would be a positive impact on the insurance policy upon the delivery of the 3 year strategic roadmap.\n\n4.\tCSA Importance:\n\n\t*\tKevork stressed the importance of the Cyber Self-Assessment (CSA) before going to market. The CSA will be reviewed by cyber experts and the advisory team to ensure minimum basic cyber hygiene is met before they can approach the market.\n\n5.\tInternal Messaging:\n\n\t*\tDee clarified with Hagop the internal messaging to ensure no over-promising and to align on the current status and next steps as discussed, which is that we are submitting to brokers to explore the market and understand who will be willing to insure based on submissions.",
