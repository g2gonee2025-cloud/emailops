In the event of a loss, Level UAE would be compensated and would remit the amount to you in turn. This would be the structure if there is interest from the insurance providers we work with. I AM NOT SURE YOU CAN CASCADE ALSO TO USA THE FULL COVERAGE.\n\nI WANT TO MAKE CLEAR THAT WE WANT TO INSURE BOTH : ALL GOODS IN TRANSIT AND GOODS SITTING IN THE WAREHOUSE (NET OF THE INSURANCE PROVIDED BY OUR 3PL). CAN A UAE INSURANCE COVER SUCH RISKS IN A FOREIGN MARKET?\n\n \n\nOne last thing: when would you ideally need the insurance to start? MERCHANDISE IS STARTING TO ARRIVE NOW TO THE 3PL FACILITY. SO THE SOONER, THE BETTER\n\n \n\nBest Regards,\n\nHagop\n\n \n\n \n\nHAGOP GHAZARIAN\n\nSPECIALIST ‑ ADMINISTRATION\n\nM.C.T.
