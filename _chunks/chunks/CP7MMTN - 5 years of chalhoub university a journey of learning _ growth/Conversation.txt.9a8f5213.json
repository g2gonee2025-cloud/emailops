What began as a vision to unify and elevate learning across the Group has grown into a future-focused platform, one that has redefined how we learn, grow, and lead in new ways.\n\nOur progress would not have been possible without each of you, our learners, ambassadors, partners, and leaders who made learning matter every day. \n\n <https://onechalhoubmedia.connexionsnow.com/07abe503ef270407c90b3747bc7d0a001464766060.gif>",

Since then, we have re-envisioned what learning can look like, moving away from transactional, pay-per-course models toward a subscription-based ecosystem that promotes continuous, limitless development.\n\n <https://onechalhoubmedia.connexionsnow.com/26dc61dafa3cb9dff1f21d90cce2afa0924014277.gif> \t\n\nWe established 5 specialised Academies, embraced hybrid learning, and embedded flexibility and feedback at the core of our design. Our collective commitment has not gone unnoticed. With accreditations from KHDA (UAE), TVTC (KSA), and CIBTAC (UAE) we achieved over 600,000 learning hours delivered since inception. With a 2024 Net Promoter Score (NPS) of 9.57/10 and growing recognition as a strategic partner in capability building, Chalhoub University has become a regional benchmark for learning excellence.\n\n\nThe Next 5: Learning Reimagined\nFrom Platform to Culture",
