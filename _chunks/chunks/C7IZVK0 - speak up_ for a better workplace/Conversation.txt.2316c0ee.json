One of the keyways we uphold this commitment is through Speak Up®.\n\n <https://pukschalhoub.blob.core.windows.net/public-media/fZ4ObtYI8E-rji-JaTqxoA/550623/439E653A206523EC789B73A1D7FBBAA1/74j09445.jpg> \t\n\nWhat is Speak Up®?\n\nSpeak Up® is a safe and confidential third-party platform for you to report concerns and breaches of our Code of Ethics in our workplace.

If you don’t feel comfortable sharing your concerns with your manager, People Partner or HR ops, you can use Speak-Up. Here are some common scenarios where Speak-Up® might be helpful:\n\n- Harassment, Discrimination or Microaggressions: If you or a colleague faces verbal or physical harassment, bullying, or discrimination—whether it’s a noticeable incident or a subtle microaggression.\n\n- Conflicts of Interest: In cases of favoritism, bribery, or undisclosed family ties in business decisions.\n\n- Unethical Workplace Behavior: Misuse of data and resources, theft, or any inappropriate behavior that threatens the Group’s values.\n\n- Feedback for improvement: Working conditions, health and safety issues, or processes and procedures\n\n <https://pukschalhoub.blob.core.windows.net/public-media/fZ4ObtYI8E-rji-JaTqxoA/550624/E4095445165BE0788D1B34ACDD53592C/uae_boh10.jpg> \t\n\nConfidentiality and Anonymity\n\nWe deal with all situations with complete discretion, respect, and sensitivity. This applies to everyone involved in a Speak Up® case: you as the initial messenger, the witnesses, and the reported person.",
