Below, please find our detailed feedback on each point for your review:\n\n________________________________\n\n1. Lack of Clarity in the Process for Updating Insurance Policy Coverage\n\nWe acknowledge the absence of clearly documented guidelines and workflows for insurance-related activities, including:\n\n*\tRequesting information\n*\tNotifying newly formed entities\n*\tAdding or removing locations\n*\tDeclaring and managing incidents\n*\tHandling other miscellaneous insurance service requests",

This is due to the vested interest of all parties in ensuring insurance compliance. Additionally, several operational safeguards mitigate this risk:\n\n*\tNew stores cannot commence operations without proof of insurance, which is mandatory across the group.\n*\tMall management requires active insurance documentation to issue work permits at all locations.\n*\tIn free zones, employee registration systems are linked to the insurance policy period, automatically blocking access to services if coverage is not renewed.\n\nDespite these measures, we fully recognize the importance of having clear, documented procedures to improve efficiency and accountability. To address this, we are committed to developing comprehensive Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) that will:\n\n*\tClearly define roles, responsibilities, and procedural requirements for all stakeholders.\n*\tStreamline processes for incident reporting and claims management.\n*\tImprove tracking, accountability, and transparency for all involved parties.",

Absence of Insurance for Cyber Fraud–Driven Losses\n\nWe acknowledge the potential financial risks posed by cyber threats, particularly given the increasing sophistication of cyberattacks and reliance on digital platforms.\n\nTo address these risks, we have initiated steps to secure cyber insurance coverage that includes protection against financial losses arising from cyber-related threats, such as fraudulent fund transfers. We anticipate finalizing this coverage by Q1 2025, which will strengthen our risk management framework and enhance our resilience against cyberattacks targeting digital payment channels.\n\n________________________________\n\n3. Inconsistencies in Group-Wide Insurance Coverage\n\nYour findings identified 156 instances across the UAE, KSA, Bahrain, Qatar, Egypt, and Kuwait where certain entities appeared to be excluded from respective insurance policies. After conducting a thorough review, we confirm that these do not constitute material coverage gaps for the following reasons:",

If any material concerns remain unresolved, we are prepared to provide additional evidence to ensure complete clarity.\n\n________________________________\n\n4.

Absence of Money Insurance Coverage Across the Group\n\nWe note your concern regarding the absence of a standalone policy covering potential loss of money during transit, on-premises, or in safes. Below are key factors that mitigate this concern:\n\n*\tEmployees do not carry cash for commercial purposes.\n*\tOur security provider offers full risk transfer by transporting store cash in armoured vehicles, insuring up to USD 500,000 for loss while in their custody.\n*\tPetty cash transfers, while not covered under current provisions, represent a relatively small exposure involving immaterial amounts.\n*\tCash stored in safes is now fully covered under our property insurance policy, up to USD 15,000, which is sufficient for almost all our stores.\n\n________________________________\n\nThank you again for your support and collaboration. If you have any additional questions or need further clarification, please don’t hesitate to reach out. We appreciate your efforts and look forward to finalizing the audit.\n\nBest Regards,\nHagop\n\n \n\n________________________________\n\nHAGOP GHAZARIAN​​​​\n\nSPECIALIST ‑ ADMINISTRATION\n\nM.C.T.

Please note these are not final, sharing them only for discussion and validation.\n\n \n\nFinding Name\n\nFinding Description\n\nLack of Clarity in the Process for Updating Insurance Policy Coverage\n\nCurrently, insurance for all Managed Companies across the Group is centrally managed by Administration Specialist from the Group Administration Department. Insurance coverage obtained by the Group includes Property All Risk Insurance, General Liability Insurance, Marine Insurance, Management Liability Insurance, Political Risk Insurance and Fidelity Guarantee Insurance.\nWe noted that the process for adding or removing businesses and locations under the Group's various insurance policies lacks clear documentation and defined procedures. This ambiguity increases the risk of gaps in coverage or inadvertent omissions, potentially leaving critical assets uninsured or incurring unnecessary costs for redundant coverage.\n\nAbsence of insurance for Cyber Fraud driven losses\n\nWe noted that there is no insurance coverage to mitigate financial risks associated with fraudulent fund transfers resulting from cybercrime or account compromise.\nWith the growing sophistication of cyberattacks and the increasing reliance on digital banking and payment platforms, this absence creates a critical vulnerability in the Group’s risk management framework.\n\nInconsistencies in Group-Wide Insurance Coverage",

Specifically, a total of 156 instances (Marine Insurance - 56,  Property All Risk Insurance - 53 and Liability Insurance - 47) were identified where entities located in UAE, KSA, Bahrain, Qatar, Egypt, and Kuwait were not included in the respective insurance policies. This creates potential financial and operational risks in case of claims or incidents involving these uncovered entities.\nPlease refer to Appendix 01 for details of the instances noted (already shared earlier)\n\nAbsence of Money Insurance coverage across the Group\n\nWe noted that the Group currently lacks an insurance policy to cover risks associated with the loss of money during transit, on-premises, or in safes due to any unforeseen events. This exposes the company to potential financial losses in scenarios where cash is targeted.\n\n \n\nRegards,\n\n \n\nNIRMA HINGORANI​​​​\n\nSENIOR INTERNAL AUDITOR\n\nM.C.T.
