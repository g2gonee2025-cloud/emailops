For both, the number of documents required for a new contract (not a renewal) is substantial, especially the requirements related to the Ultimate beneficiary owner. This might cause a delay in KUW and most probably in BAH, as the incorporation is not finalized yet.",

From our side, if this is the request from Chalhoub, we will try to prepare all the docs with your help, However, in case it is not possible to close the request on time, we are kindly relying on the fact that Chalhoub (either C&B and/or H&C) is going to cover us. That means, the renewal will be under Chalhoub umbrella, if we are not able to get coverage under ZIM entities on time.\n\n \n\nPlease let me know if we are all aligned and if my understanding is correct. \n\n \n\nThanks again once more to all of you for your help with these openings!\n\n \n\nRegards,\n\nMarco \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------\nID: C6X4ROW_01\nFrom: Nancy Liu <Nancy.Liu@zimmermann.com>\nTo: Marco Arletti <Marco.Arletti@me.zimmermann.com>; Hagop Ghazarian <Hagop.Ghazarian@chalhoub.com>; Saima Ahmed <Saima.Ahmed@chalhoub.com>\nCC: Marine Hutin <Marine.Hutin@me.zimmermann.com>; George Hammouch <Georges.Hamouche@chalhoub.com>\nBCC: \nDate: 2025-08-20 08:31\nSubject: RE: ZIM Insurance coverage - BAH and KUW\n--------------------------------------------------\nDear Hagop,\n\n \n\nI hope this finds you well.",
