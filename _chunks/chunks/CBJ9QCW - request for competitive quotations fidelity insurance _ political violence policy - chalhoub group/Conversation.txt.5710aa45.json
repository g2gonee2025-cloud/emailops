Furthermore, if both PV and Commercial Crime are awarded together, the savings would increase to 15%. We were hoping to receive an indication of the award price for both lines so that we could rework a combined offer. However, if we are to proceed with individual assessments, please find attached the revised offer for PV, which includes two options: one with Terrorism Liability and one without.\n\n \n\nAll subjectivities have been listed in the attached report, to be complied with at the binding stage.  As you’re aware, you will also need to comply with the KYC requirement pursuant to the CBUAE regulations, that too is captured in the “introduction” section of the attached report.\n\n \n\nRegarding the Commercial Crime coverage, we require some additional information to finalize our negotiations with underwriters for further discounts. I appreciate that you’ve provided this before, but for clarity and completeness, I would be grateful if you could confirm the following details as we discussed:",

Since then, we’ve implemented stricter security measures. Additionally, we’ve had a few smaller incidents of cash theft by store employees, with relatively minor amounts ranging from AED 20,000 to AED 50,000.\n*\tExisting Policies: I’ve also attached details of our current policies for your reference.\n\n \n\nPolitical Violence (PV) Insurance\n\n \n\n*\tFull Sum Insured: Details of the full sum insured are attached.\n*\tLoss History: The PV loss history is clean, with no incidents to report.\n*\tCoverage for New Locations: We have over 500 locations, so it’s important to establish a method for covering new locations without requiring declarations each time.

Furthermore, if both PV and Commercial Crime are awarded together, the savings would increase to 15%. We were hoping to receive an indication of the award price for both lines so that we could rework a combined offer. However, if we are to proceed with individual assessments, please find attached the revised offer for PV, which includes two options: one with Terrorism Liability and one without.\n\n \n\nAll subjectivities have been listed in the attached report, to be complied with at the binding stage.  As you’re aware, you will also need to comply with the KYC requirement pursuant to the CBUAE regulations, that too is captured in the “introduction” section of the attached report.\n\n \n\nRegarding the Commercial Crime coverage, we require some additional information to finalize our negotiations with underwriters for further discounts.
