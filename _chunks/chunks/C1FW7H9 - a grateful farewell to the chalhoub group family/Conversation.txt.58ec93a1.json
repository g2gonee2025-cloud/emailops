It has been a true honour and privilege to witness firsthand the dedication, passion, and innovation that defines our organization.\n\n \n\nThroughout my time here, I have been fortunate to work alongside some of the most talented and inspiring individuals in the industry, from Bahrain to UAE and now in KSA. The support and camaraderie that I have experienced are invaluable, and from that stemmed my most cherished friendships.\n\n \n\nAs I bid farewell, I want you all to know that Chalhoub Group will always hold a special place in my heart. The memories we have shared, the challenges we have overcome, and the successes we have celebrated together will forever be remembered.",
