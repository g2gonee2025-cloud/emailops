We currently have a client who has nearly confirmed the quotation and is eager to move forward with the lease agreement. However, we've encountered a critical obstacle that requires your immediate attention.\n\n\n\n\nThe client operates a last-mile delivery company where drivers are personally responsible for excess charges. The current excess amount of 5,000 AED represents a significant burden that makes this deal commercially unviable. To put this in perspective, standard excess charges typically range below 1,000 AED for vehicles in this category, even for vans valued at 135,000 AED.",

We urgently need your support and NASCO's assistance to reduce the excess charges to below 1,000 AED to ensure this deal moves forward successfully.\n\n\n\n\nI would appreciate your prompt consideration of this matter, as the client is ready to proceed once this issue is resolved.\n\n\n\n\nBest regards,\n\nJackie Merchant \nEV Leasing & Rental\n+971 58 541 4500\n <https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1-Ddizmpxe9_kDi6uzmzWJjHqGqyKkU0f&export=download> \nBuilding 6, The Greenhouse\nDubai Design District\nDubai, UAE",
