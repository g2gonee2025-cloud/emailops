Insurers value the level of support provided by recognized showrooms like Al Futtaim and Al Nabooda during claims, which has positively influenced underwriting decisions.\n\n\t\t \n\n\t\tSince they do not have any visibility on the coming Chinese vehicles, they either decline to provide a comprehensive cover or the rates are high.\n\n\t\t \n\n\t\tOn the alternate options, at this time, SUKOON Insurance is not extending coverage to rental car companies, and LIVA is currently unable to onboard with these vehicles. \n\n\t\t \n\n\t\t \n\n\t\t \n\n\t\tBest Regards,\n\n\t\t \n\n\t\tMridul Nambiar M.B.A CII (AWARD) \n\n\t\tAssistant Manager - Motor\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\tNasco Middle East\n\t\tP.O.
