Transactions from XStore and E-Commerce sales will be successfully posted into SIOCS prior to midnight, ensuring accurate stock snapshots are reflected across E-Commerce platforms.\n\n \n\nAs a precautionary measure, a full reconciliation activity will be conducted over the next 24 hours to validate that the recent outage has not impacted stock accuracy.\n\n \n\nWe will continue to closely monitor all systems to ensure stability and optimal performance.\n\n \n\nFor support during this period, please raise a ticket via OneReach. You can also check real-time status updates via the Tech&Data System Status & Health <https://onereach.status.freshservice.com/>  Dashboard.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThis mail was sent to you by\n\n <https://onereach.chalhoub.com/support/home>",
