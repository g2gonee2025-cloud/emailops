As a result, no direct changes can be made to the policy wording, as insurers rely on this standardization to price the risk reliably and to minimize unpredictability.\n\nHowever, we can include certain technical requirements as special conditions above and beyond the general wording—think of it as an addendum sheet.

As such, the correct comparison is between Orient Takaful via Nasco and Beazley via Marsh.\n\nThat being said, I agree that the Beazley proposal is the stronger option overall. In terms of coverage, both proposals are quite similar; however, Beazley has a few key advantages over the Orient proposal:\n\n\n*\t\n\tEvent Limitation: Orient's proposal includes an event limitation of 28 days, effectively resetting the policy every 28 days. This means a single incident could be considered as multiple claims, each with a separate USD 250k deductible, which is a significant downside.",

However, Beazley has a slight edge as they are the leading provider of cyber insurance globally, insuring approximately 7% of the worldwide. Also, Beazley was the first insurer to introduce first-party cyber coverage and has extensive experience in the field. Additionally, Beazley’s add-on services are more adaptable to the cyber-readiness needs of the group.\n\nCFC also offers excellent services with a more tech-driven approach, including real-time cyber news updates, dark web monitoring, etc. However, the value of these services will depend on how relevant they are to our specific needs based on our profile.",

The Orient policy is fully reinsured with Lloyd’s, while Beazley’s holds 50% directly, with the remaining 50% reinsured to Zurich (A+ rated) on follower basis.\n\nOverall, Beazley’s structure is leaner and potentially more efficient, with the chain being: \n\n\nChalhoub -> Marsh -> Beazley           vs\nChalhoub -> Nasco -> Orient -> Lloyd’s\n\nAs for feedback on the brokers, Marsh demonstrated significantly higher technical expertise than Nasco both in person and which also showed with their proposals. Their proposals were cleaner, more complete, and required fewer amendments, while Nasco’s proposals had  subjectivities and always required additional information or changes to make them viable.\n\nFinally, in terms of structuring the policy, I would recommend a minimum two-year agreement with predefined renewal conditions. As you have seen, the cyber insurance placement process is very intrusive and requires considerable information to be share for proper underwriting. A two-year term would allow for a reassessment of the group’s risk profile as the rollouts you have planned progress.\n\nRegarding the meeting, I would appreciate it if you could suggest a suitable timing, including Kamran and Joe.
