Currently, Administration Specialist is intimated by Group Legal Department or the Administration Department of the respective Country on an ad hoc basis regarding the new entities / businesses or closures. \nThis increases the risk of gaps in coverage or inadvertent omissions, potentially leaving critical assets uninsured or incurring unnecessary costs for redundant coverage.\n\nLevel 1\n\nThe Admin department should:\n1) Develop Standard Operating Procedures for the timely addition or removal of businesses and locations from insurance policies and Include steps for initiating, reviewing, and approving changes in coverage.\n2) Assign clear accountability to specific roles across verticals for ensuring accurate and timely updates to insurance policies.\n3) Implement a monitoring mechanism of insured assets and locations to ensure that the insurance policy aligns with current operational requirements and maintain an up-to-date register of insured locations and assets.",

This exposes the company to potential financial losses in scenarios where cash is targeted.\nIt is pertinent to note that there is a third party cash collection and deposit service provider that covers the risk of cash in transit while in their custody for up to 500K USD for store locations in UAE, KSA, Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar. India also uses a third party collection service. \nHowever, this control is not present in Jordan, Oman and Egypt Duty free shops and excludes cash maintained in office safes. \n\nLevel 2\n\nInsurance team to calculate the financial exposure for the uncovered markets and locations and present the cost of insurance as part of the upcoming  insurance coverage renewal exercise. \n\nWe note your concern regarding the absence of a standalone policy covering potential loss of money during transit, on-premises, or in safes.
