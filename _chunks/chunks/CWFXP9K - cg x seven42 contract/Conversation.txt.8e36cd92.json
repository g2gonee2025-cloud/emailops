Their individual contracts include clauses holding them accountable for any damage incurred due to their own negligence, not the planning agency.\n\n \n\nAs for insurance, this is usually provided by the client or by the venue itself. That said, we can look into obtaining an event-specific insurance policy should MOTF or CG be unable to provide one, but please note that this would be charged separately depending on the provider and the terms.\n\n \n\nWith respect to workers’ compensation insurance, Seven42 remains responsible for our internal team. However, this clause would be included in the contracts signed with each individual supplier, who in turn are responsible for their own crew and staff. If there’s a specific waiver or form you’d like us to share with suppliers, we’re more than happy to do so.\n\n \n\nOn the Excel sheet, PHASE 1 that you’ve seen remains unchanged at this stage.

It’s a proposal that also serves as our working contract. If you have a different template or contract that your legal department would prefer us to use, we’re of course happy to review and sign it.\n\n \n\nRegarding the security deposit clause, this typically falls under the responsibility of each supplier. Their individual contracts include clauses holding them accountable for any damage incurred due to their own negligence, not the planning agency.\n\n \n\nAs for insurance, this is usually provided by the client or by the venue itself. That said, we can look into obtaining an event-specific insurance policy should MOTF or CG be unable to provide one, but please note that this would be charged separately depending on the provider and the terms.\n\n \n\nWith respect to workers’ compensation insurance, Seven42 remains responsible for our internal team. However, this clause would be included in the contracts signed with each individual supplier, who in turn are responsible for their own crew and staff. If there’s a specific waiver or form you’d like us to share with suppliers, we’re more than happy to do so.",
