The attacker targeted a section on the website during checkout where customers can enter their mobile numbers to receive an OTP, this OTP then creates or links their Loyalty program account. The attacker executed scripts in sending a significant number of SMS One Time Passwords being to foreign numbers resulting in an abnormal SMS bill. It’s important to note that whilst Level Shoes is part of Chalhoub Group, the technology is managed independently by Level Shoes team themselves.\n\nActions undertaken: Identified section which was attacked was protected with CAPTCHA and global rate limiting.
